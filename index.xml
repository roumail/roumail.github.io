&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that period when most parts of the world were in a lockdown due to
COVID? Yes, we&amp;rsquo;re nearing the end of 2023 and COVID seems like a distant memory
at this point. However, like I imagine many of us, I suddenly found that being
restricted in movement and social interaction to a large extent, I had a lot
more time at my disposal. This was also a time where my wife and I realised that
we could have more space for ourselves so each of us could have an office setup
we could be happy with. This also being a time of low interest rates to
encourage consumption in the economy, it was an especially interesting property
market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed as good a time as any to write a scraper for Belgium&amp;rsquo;s most popular
property listings website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://immoweb.be&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;immoweb&lt;/a&gt;. My desire for this
first version was to first, be able to have a very general idea of the Brussels
property market. Thereafter, I would launch this script every few days to look
at the new  properties. The output of this script would be a CSV that I&amp;rsquo;d use
to spot good deals and have all the relevant information I&amp;rsquo;d need to schedule
visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementing-the-proof-of-concept&#34;&gt;Implementing the Proof of concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was running this script from a windows machine at the time and having done a
scraping project once before already, knew that I&amp;rsquo;d start with &lt;code&gt;selenium&lt;/code&gt; for
the browser automation and parsing of the html. The setup required that I choose
a browser and a corresponding geckodriver (with the appropriate version for your
browser) to go along with it. I&amp;rsquo;ve used firefox and edge browsers (and their
respective drivers) for different iterations of the  scraper implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After messing around with developer tools, looking into the dom&amp;rsquo;s containing
the information I was looking for using &lt;code&gt;inspect&lt;/code&gt;, I had a script that was doing
the job. I made a conda export of the environment I used for the scraping in
case I ever needed to revisit this work again. This script did the job and I
was quite happy leaving it at that with an environment export so I could pick
up from this analysis when needed. This version of the script can be found
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roumail/immoweb-scraper/tree/second_run&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for
those who are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sidenote-on-bayesian-statistics&#34;&gt;A sidenote on Bayesian statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of Bayesian statistics. Being able to
explicitly encode your modelling assumptions in the form of priors, as well as
being very deliberate in reconstructing the data generating process of the
phenomenon you&amp;rsquo;re modelling. You can visually verify how well your model is
generalizing by doing what is called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_predictive_distribution&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;posterior predictive check&lt;/a&gt;. The computational aspects of MCMC sampling
also appeals to the nerd in me, while the convergence of your sampler gives
indications about how well-informed a hypothesis you have for your data
generating process. An ill-formulated model will simply not converge,
unlike a number of other approaches which would always give a solution and then
you&amp;rsquo;re left to figure out if you&amp;rsquo;re overfitting or underfitting. Then there is
the fact that you are always able to work with distributions of your phenomenon
of interest rather than relying solely on point estimates like we would in most
other methods. There&amp;rsquo;s a number of fascinating things that are possible with
these posterior distributions, which include bayesian decision making. I will
link to a great discussion on the subject by Thomas Wiecki on the subject
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twiecki.io/blog/2019/01/14/supply_chain/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where we can see how
to use our models to directly show the impact of uncertainy on real business
metrics rather than arcane statistical metrics such as &lt;code&gt;mean squared error&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;f1 score&lt;/code&gt; and the like which don&amp;rsquo;t hold any real business meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I have my bias for these methods and using these models bring their
own challenges. In some cases, traditional machine learning approaches would
give better performance without sacrificing interpretability and help you reach
a conclusion faster than using these bespoke modelling approaches. Nonetheless,
I was on the lookout for an opportunity to find a dataset where I could exploit
the natural hierarchical structure of data in a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_hierarchical_modeling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hierarchical modelling&lt;/a&gt;
or the flexiblity of Gaussian process modelling to capture the intricaties of
non-linear processes. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gaussian_processes/GP-smoothing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; shows the distinction between modelling
the same problem as a regression vs using a gaussian process smoothing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;revisiting-the-implementation-once-again&#34;&gt;Revisiting the implementation once again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any data scientist or machine learning practitioner will tell you about their
struggles with data. It&amp;rsquo;s either data quality (or lack thereof) or just the lack
of data itself for performing interesting analyses. Then it suddenly occurred
to me: property data is perfect for the experiments I wanted to conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scraping property prices over time gives the opportunity to model property
prices over time and ask interesting questions, including, but not limited to
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are rental property prices growing at the same rate as purchase properties?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we observe a similar growth rate across different communes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are properties in the same commune priced similarly and if so, how much does
this vary by commune?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the most important determinants of price?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dataset of this nature contains elements of time series analysis since
property prices evolve over time. There is also a natural structure in the data
that can be exploited since we can indeed expect properties within communes to
be similarly priced. This would be a place where we can use Gaussian process
modelling to capture the underlying trends and fluctuations in property
prices within each commune. We can use property proximity to model the inherent
spatial relationships between properties, assuming that properties closer to
each other are more likely to have similar prices!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By revisiting my initial scraper implementation with this newfound focus, I am
not just enhancing a tool; I am building a robust data collection pipeline
that will serve as the backbone for these sophisticated analytical experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;areas-of-improvement&#34;&gt;Areas of improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a clear goal in mind, I identified several key areas to refine the
scraper&amp;rsquo;s implementation. These improvements were aimed at making the scraper
more efficient, easier to manage, and more robust for data collection and
analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-efficiency-in-data-scraping&#34;&gt;1. Efficiency in Data Scraping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch to Beautiful Soup: I wanted to transition from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/selenium/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Beautiful Soup&lt;/a&gt; for parsing raw
HTML. This change ought to significantly reduced the time needed to scrape data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parametrization of Postal Codes: Allowing postal codes as an input parameter
to make the scraper more flexible. I was initially only looking into a few
communes in Brussels that I was interested in. However, if I wanted to do some
interesting analyses, I also wanted to consider communes neighboring Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-dependency-management&#34;&gt;2. Dependency Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of Poetry: To manage the project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies more effectively, I
wanted to convert the script into a Python package and used &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt; for managing
the dependencies. This streamlines the installation process and allows me to
manage the package versions in a systematic version. This would be especially
useful as we dockerize the analysis in the future and build a CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation of Typer: I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/typer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Typer&lt;/a&gt; to
create a command-line interface from the main application entrypoint. I&amp;rsquo;ve
effectively transitioned to using this instead of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/click/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-code-refactoring-for-readability-and-maintainability&#34;&gt;3. Code Refactoring for Readability and Maintainability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object-Oriented Approach: I wanted to refactor the code to use Python classes
instead of just functions where appropriate. By using meaningful class names, the
code can become self-documenting and easier to maintain and extend in the long
run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-data-storage-and-validation&#34;&gt;5. Data Storage and Validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite Database: I wanted to use a SQLite database with an initial schema to
store the data I&amp;rsquo;d be accumulating over time. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed working with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the ORM mapper to interact with the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Validation with Pydantic: Before adding the scraped data to the database,
I implemented validation checks using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pydantic&lt;/a&gt;. This ensured that only
high-quality, accurate data was stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on these areas, I aimed to build a scraper that was not just a
one-off script but a robust data collection tool capable of supporting more
complex analyses and experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-comments&#34;&gt;Final comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://roumail.github.io/a-scraper-that-scales-part-ii/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in the series, I will go over the implementation details.

      <title>Welcome to my Website! 👋</title>
      <link>https://roumail.github.io/post/20231017-hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://roumail.github.io/post/20231017-hello-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exciting News: My Website is Live! 🎉&lt;br&gt;
Hello everyone, and welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rohailtaimour.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.rohailtaimour.com&lt;/a&gt;! I am incredibly excited to announce that my website is officially live. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built it Myself with Hugo 🛠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech world, there are countless ways to build a website, many of which offer quick and easy solutions. However, I chose to take a different route by building this website myself using Hugo. The journey was challenging but immensely rewarding, providing me with hands-on experience that goes beyond just writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted on GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions 🌐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most enlightening aspects of this project was learning how to host a static website using GitHub Pages and automating the deployment process with GitHub Actions. Surprisingly, this was not as daunting as it sounds, and I found the experience to be relatively straightforward. Keep an eye out for a future blog post where I&amp;rsquo;ll document this process in detail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customized to My Needs 🎨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey didn’t stop at just building the website; I’ve also customized it to suit my preferences and needs. This involved tweaking the template to accommodate blog series, implementing a contact form, and even adding the ability for visitors to comment on blog posts. One challenge still ahead is optimizing the website for SEO—turns out my MySpace account is incredibly resilient in search rankings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Coming Up 📝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website will serve as my digital canvas. I’ll use it to share my insights and experiences on a range of topics: from Python development, machine learning, and data engineering, to open-source technology frameworks and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Feedback is Welcome 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to explore the website and let me know what you think. Your feedback is invaluable and will help me continue to improve this digital space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for visiting, and stay tuned for exciting content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-line math: $x + y = z$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fragments&#34;&gt;Fragments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make content appear incrementally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}

&lt;p&gt;A fragment can accept two optional parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
