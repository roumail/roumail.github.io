I came across this quote from the book ["Essentialism"](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Greg-McKeown-audiobook/dp/B00IWYP5NI/ref=sr_1_1?crid=RZC41UQUFCF6&keywords=essentialism&qid=1698311094&s=books&sprefix=essentialism%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C150&sr=1-1) 
by Greg McKeown earlier this year which very nicely encapsulates some of the 
learnings and insights I've had over the period since COVID. The quote goes like 
this:

> Space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make

I think the COVID period forced many of us to reconsider our routines and how 
we process everyday events. One of the best things that came out of COVID for 
me was to act on a childhood dream of mine - to learn to drum! 

I grew up in a house where we enjoyed listening to different types of Music. I 
can relate to Music in a way that's helped me go cope with the challenges life 
throws at you. Listening to certain songs would transport you back in time to a
certain moment in your life so Music holds transcendental qualities for me. While 
I certainly enjoyed air guitaring to some of my favourite guitar solos like Pink 
Floyd's comfortably numb, Drumming is something that had an inexplicable allure 
for me. The raw energy and force that drumming is able to convey - the rhytmic 
elements of Music was something I naturally inlined towards. And on March 30th 
2020, my life was forever changed.

## The honeymoon period

I'm very glad I have an understanding wife and neighbours that didn't complain 
about the thumping sound and vibrations from my bass pedal. With drumming, I 
suddenly had a whole new world open up to me. Youtube was my friend and I would 
take advantage of platforms like [Drumeo](www.drumeo.com) to learn enough of 
the basics to get started. I had always been an avid music fan but I'd never 
learnt music theory and now suddenly, I realised that if I really wanted to make 
the most of online material in my learning journey, I'd need to learn how to read 
music. Thankfully, reading drum notation is rather straightforward compared to 
other instruments (or so I think). Things were all well and good until I realised
one day:

> How do I make the time to practice and reach the drumming goals I'd set for myself?

I'm quite a goal oriented person and so naturally I had set ambitious goals for 
myself. These goals were different from the ones I'd been setting for most of 
my life, which would often be related to studies or work. These were goals where 
I didn't care as much if I went off track. They were more like a north star and 
had the ability to steer me back on course if I went too far astray.

Lo and behold, I saw that the best way for me to make the time to practice was 
to start waking up at 5 am in the morning. Yes. 5 am. I had tried practice 
at more reasonable times but it just wasn't consistent. I had never thought 
there'd by anything that would make me jump out of bed this way. And now I'd 
found it. And I was jumping out of bed. During COVID. The drums helped me stay 
sane - though likely at the expense of my understanding wife's sanity ðŸ¤£.

## Choices were always there, but I never realised the implications of failing to choose
