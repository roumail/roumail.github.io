Data Storage and Validation Final comments Motivation Remember that period when most parts of the world were in a lockdown due to COVID? Yes, we‚Äôre nearing the end of 2023 and COVID seems like a distant memory at this point. However, like I imagine many of us, I suddenly found that being restricted in movement and social interaction to a large extent, I had a lot more time at my disposal. This was also a time where my wife and I realised that we could have more space for ourselves so each of us could have an office setup we could be happy with. This also being a time of low interest rates to encourage consumption in the economy, it was an especially interesting property market.\nThis seemed as good a time as any to write a scraper for Belgium‚Äôs most popular property listings website: immoweb. My desire for this first version was to first, be able to have a very general idea of the Brussels property market. Thereafter, I would launch this script every few days to look at the new properties. The output of this script would be a CSV that I‚Äôd use to spot good deals and have all the relevant information I‚Äôd need to schedule visits.\nImplementing the Proof of concept I was running this script from a windows machine at the time and having done a scraping project once before already, knew that I‚Äôd start with selenium for the browser automation and parsing of the html. The setup required that I choose a browser and a corresponding geckodriver (with the appropriate version for your browser) to go along with it. I‚Äôve used firefox and edge browsers (and their respective drivers) for different iterations of the scraper implementation.\nAfter messing around with developer tools, looking into the dom‚Äôs containing the information I was looking for using inspect, I had a script that was doing the job. I made a conda export of the environment I used for the scraping in case I ever needed to revisit this work again. This script did the job and I was quite happy leaving it at that with an environment export so I could pick up from this analysis when needed. This version of the script can be found here for those who are interested.\nA sidenote on Bayesian statistics For the longest time I‚Äôve been a fan of Bayesian statistics. Being able to explicitly encode your modelling assumptions in the form of priors, as well as being very deliberate in reconstructing the data generating process of the phenomenon you‚Äôre modelling. You can visually verify how well your model is generalizing by doing what is called a posterior predictive check. The computational aspects of MCMC sampling also appeals to the nerd in me, while the convergence of your sampler gives indications about how well-informed a hypothesis you have for your data generating process. An ill-formulated model will simply not converge, unlike a number of other approaches which would always give a solution and then you‚Äôre left to figure out if you‚Äôre overfitting or underfitting. Then there is the fact that you are always able to work with distributions of your phenomenon of interest rather than relying solely on point estimates like we would in most other methods. There‚Äôs a number of fascinating things that are possible with these posterior distributions, which include bayesian decision making. I will link to a great discussion on the subject by Thomas Wiecki on the subject here where we can see how to use our models to directly show the impact of uncertainy on real business metrics rather than arcane statistical metrics such as mean squared error, f1 score and the like which don‚Äôt hold any real business meaning.\nNaturally, I have my bias for these methods and using these models bring their own challenges. In some cases, traditional machine learning approaches would give better performance without sacrificing interpretability and help you reach a conclusion faster than using these bespoke modelling approaches. Nonetheless, I was on the lookout for an opportunity to find a dataset where I could exploit the natural hierarchical structure of data in a hierarchical modelling or the flexiblity of Gaussian process modelling to capture the intricaties of non-linear processes. The link shows the distinction between modelling the same problem as a regression vs using a gaussian process smoothing model.\nRevisiting the implementation once again Any data scientist or machine learning practitioner will tell you about their struggles with data. It‚Äôs either data quality (or lack thereof) or just the lack of data itself for performing interesting analyses. Then it suddenly occurred to me: property data is perfect for the experiments I wanted to conduct.\nScraping property prices over time gives the opportunity to model property ‚Ä¶","date":1698156840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698156840,"objectID":"5b49bc16d699569b9faaa7c1093cee21","permalink":"https://roumail.github.io/a-scraper-that-scales-part-i/","publishdate":"2023-10-24T16:14:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/a-scraper-that-scales-part-i/","section":"post","summary":"Explore the journey of building a robust web scraper for analyzing Belgium's property market.

I am incredibly excited to announce that my website is officially live. üöÄ\nBuilt it Myself with Hugo üõ†Ô∏è\nIn the tech world, there are countless ways to build a website, many of which offer quick and easy solutions. However, I chose to take a different route by building this website myself using Hugo. The journey was challenging but immensely rewarding, providing me with hands-on experience that goes beyond just writing code.\nHosted on GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions üåê\nOne of the most enlightening aspects of this project was learning how to host a static website using GitHub Pages and automating the deployment process with GitHub Actions. Surprisingly, this was not as daunting as it sounds, and I found the experience to be relatively straightforward. Keep an eye out for a future blog post where I‚Äôll document this process in detail!\nCustomized to My Needs üé®\nThe journey didn‚Äôt stop at just building the website; I‚Äôve also customized it to suit my preferences and needs. This involved tweaking the template to accommodate blog series, implementing a contact form, and even adding the ability for visitors to comment on blog posts. One challenge still ahead is optimizing the website for SEO‚Äîturns out my MySpace account is incredibly resilient in search rankings!\nWhat‚Äôs Coming Up üìù\nThis website will serve as my digital canvas. I‚Äôll use it to share my insights and experiences on a range of topics: from Python development, machine learning, and data engineering, to open-source technology frameworks and beyond.\nYour Feedback is Welcome üôè\nFeel free to explore the website and let me know what you think.
