The toughest decisions for me often involved saying no. No to something cool I wanted to do, without first finishing something else I had started. It’s okay to change your mind about what’s important to you, as long as that’s not erratic.\nI received a lot of help in getting this clarify from Kris, who supported me in identifying and shortlisting the top most values I held dear. Naturally, this was an iterative process and I believe this is an exercise one can revisit multiple times since your values may slowly shift over time. Heading into this exercise, I had the following goals, in no particular order and non-exhaustive:\nBe super clear on the different roles I “identify” with Find ways of making “sustainable” progress on each of the identified roles above Cut out procrastination from my life so I can move forward with my identified priorities Refine my productivity systems to get the most out of them without overwhelming myself Having tools and systems I can fall back on to handle moments of anxiety and uncertainty Understand better what makes me tick and refine how I “channel” my attention Learning to appreciate the moment as it is instead of trying to control it Find ways of channeling my creativity in ways that are healthy and don’t consume me Revisit some of the fundamental beliefs I held about myself and the world around me As can be seen, this wasn’t a short list of goals and I headed into my sessions with Kris with an open mind and heart. My one and only true goal was to come out of these sessions in a place where I was content with where I was.\nYour attention as a spider web Everyone’s likely had that moment when you are suddenly able to separate you, the one who notices, from the voice in your head. Oftentimes, it is a momentary experience and soon enough you’re back to being completely identified with that voice. That voice in your head, if allowed, can completely take over how you perceive reality. Through the process of self-reflection and writing a journal during certain crucial moments, I noticed how fickle your though process can be. Trying reading what you wrote ten days ago and how far removed you may feel from your own thoughts that felt all-encompassing the moment you were experiencing them. This was a revelation to me and to anyone interested in hearing someone describe these concepts can look upon The Artist’s Way and The Untethered Soul.\nAs mentioned in The Untethered Soul, the voice in your head is like the annoying room mate that you can’t get rid of and you have to learn to live with. This voice has a tendency to create a spider web where the fundamental beliefs you hold about yourself would pull you in and trap you from being to see things for how they truly are.\nWhile this revelation already did wonders in how I began to deal with certain situations in my life, make sure to take the time to respond, rather than reacting. Making sure that my actions were grounded in the values I cherished rather than from a place of fear, insecurity, etc. Nevertheless, I will speak about three ideas in particular which made a huge difference in my life:\nAchieving goals may need you to make sacrifices The choosing is losing mindset. Better to keep my options “open” “The myth of the ‘perfect time’ for tackling big challenges” Sacrifices needed to achieve your goals Most of us desire better than what we have today - but what are you willing to give up to achieve those goals? This one was an eye opener for me when I saw how I could change my “victim” mindset, where I was expecting things to be a certain way without really giving up something in return. I’m normally super vigilant about viewing myself as a “victim” in a given situation. I think it’s very natural for us to fall into that pattern since it’s very convenient to shift responsibility to something external. This self-defense mechanism prevents us to feeling “less than” since the reason we’re not where we want to be is not in our control.\nEverytime I’ve noticed this mindset, I’ve immediately resolved it by finding ways that I can either influence the situation using levers that are under my control and if the situation is truly outside my control altogether, to simply find ways to come to terms with the situation. Find a way to accept the situation as it is: stop fighting reality.\nIn my previous post in the series, I talked about the time I started waking up at 5 am in the morning to get consistent around my drumming. I started doing this because I began noticing the voice in my head making excuses for me about how “busy” I am and how poor old me isn’t able to progress on their goals because there just …","date":1698337471,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698337471,"objectID":"9dcb90c7c8f6dd71a8848ff8596bccf7","permalink":"https://rohailtaimour.com/personal-values-part-ii/","publishdate":"2023-10-26T18:24:31+02:00","relpermalink":"/personal-values-part-ii/","section":"post","summary":"In this thought-provoking sequel to 'Decoding Rohail,' I explore the transformative power of identifying core values, making conscious choices, and overcoming procrastination.

The quote goes like this:\nSpace to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make\nTaking the plunge and buying my first drum set I think the COVID period forced many of us to reconsider our routines and how we process everyday events. One of the best things that came out of COVID for me was to act on a childhood dream of mine - to learn to drum!\nI grew up in a house where we enjoyed listening to different types of Music. I can relate to Music in a way that’s helped me go cope with the challenges life throws at you. Listening to certain songs would transport you back in time to a certain moment in your life so Music holds transcendental qualities for me. While I certainly enjoyed air guitaring to some of my favourite guitar solos like Pink Floyd’s comfortably numb, Drumming is something that had an inexplicable allure for me. The raw energy and force that drumming is able to convey - the rhytmic elements of Music was something I naturally inlined towards. And on March 30th 2020, my life was forever changed.\nYamaha DTX 452 The honeymoon period I’m very glad I have an understanding wife and neighbours that didn’t complain about the thumping sound and vibrations from my bass pedal. With drumming, I suddenly had a whole new world open up to me. Youtube was my friend and I would take advantage of platforms like Drumeo to learn enough of the basics to get started. I had always been an avid music fan but I’d never learnt music theory and now suddenly, I realised that if I really wanted to make the most of online material in my learning journey, I’d need to learn how to read music. Thankfully, reading drum notation is rather straightforward compared to other instruments (or so I think). Things were all well and good until I realised one day:\nHow do I make the time to practice and reach the drumming goals I’d set for myself?\nI’m quite a goal oriented person and so naturally I had set ambitious goals for myself. These goals were different from the ones I’d been setting for most of my life, which would often be related to studies or work. These were goals where I didn’t care as much if I went off track. They were more like a north star and had the ability to steer me back on course if I went too far astray.\nLo and behold, I saw that the best way for me to make the time to practice was to start waking up at 5 am in the morning. Yes. 5 am. I had tried practice at more reasonable times but it just wasn’t consistent. I had never thought there’d by anything that would make me jump out of bed this way. And now I’d found it. And I was jumping out of bed. During COVID. The drums helped me stay sane - though likely at the expense of my understanding wife’s sanity 🤣.\nI was experimenting with different material, playing along to songs I loved and even started learning to play open handed where instead of crossing your hands so your right (for most people, dominant) hand is on the hihat keeping time and you use your left hand on the snare. By playing open handed, as a right handed drummer, I was using my left hand to keep time, which meant I was using it on average 4 times more than my right hand. This was incredibly awkward and frustrating in the beginning. However, I stuck to it and configured my kit to suit this style of playing too:\nHi hat (left) setup incredibly low for open handed playing A typical practice session eventually came to be an hour or more of playing between 2-3 exercises, on a 15-20 minute break. Sound boring? I found it to be rather meditative actually. This setup was a result of a lot of self-reflection on what makes a good practice session. Benny Greb’s Effective practicing for musicians had a lot of wisdom to share on the topic and much like Essentialism, the message was the same: Choosing is not losing. You need to make choices to go deeper and further on your topic of interest. This is especially true for something like drumming where there is more than an analytical understanding that you need to undertake to execute a particular pattern on the drums. You need to literally drill that pattern down into your body to the point where your muscle memory can take over and execute the pattern instinctively at will.\nComing to this realisation wasn’t easy. While it’s great having all this information on our finger tips with platforms like youtube and social media but these platforms are also a constant reminder of the different way’s that you’re not enough where you are right now.

Data Storage and Validation Final comments Motivation Remember that period when most parts of the world were in a lockdown due to COVID? Yes, we’re nearing the end of 2023 and COVID seems like a distant memory at this point. However, like I imagine many of us, I suddenly found that being restricted in movement and social interaction to a large extent, I had a lot more time at my disposal. This was also a time where my wife and I realised that we could have more space for ourselves so each of us could have an office setup we could be happy with. This also being a time of low interest rates to encourage consumption in the economy, it was an especially interesting property market.\nThis seemed as good a time as any to write a scraper for Belgium’s most popular property listings website: immoweb. My desire for this first version was to first, be able to have a very general idea of the Brussels property market. Thereafter, I would launch this script every few days to look at the new properties. The output of this script would be a CSV that I’d use to spot good deals and have all the relevant information I’d need to schedule visits.\nImplementing the Proof of concept I was running this script from a windows machine at the time and having done a scraping project once before already, knew that I’d start with selenium for the browser automation and parsing of the html. The setup required that I choose a browser and a corresponding geckodriver (with the appropriate version for your browser) to go along with it. I’ve used firefox and edge browsers (and their respective drivers) for different iterations of the scraper implementation.\nAfter messing around with developer tools, looking into the dom’s containing the information I was looking for using inspect, I had a script that was doing the job. I made a conda export of the environment I used for the scraping in case I ever needed to revisit this work again. This script did the job and I was quite happy leaving it at that with an environment export so I could pick up from this analysis when needed. This version of the script can be found here for those who are interested.\nA sidenote on Bayesian statistics For the longest time I’ve been a fan of Bayesian statistics. Being able to explicitly encode your modelling assumptions in the form of priors, as well as being very deliberate in reconstructing the data generating process of the phenomenon you’re modelling. You can visually verify how well your model is generalizing by doing what is called a posterior predictive check. The computational aspects of MCMC sampling also appeals to the nerd in me, while the convergence of your sampler gives indications about how well-informed a hypothesis you have for your data generating process. An ill-formulated model will simply not converge, unlike a number of other approaches which would always give a solution and then you’re left to figure out if you’re overfitting or underfitting. Then there is the fact that you are always able to work with distributions of your phenomenon of interest rather than relying solely on point estimates like we would in most other methods. There’s a number of fascinating things that are possible with these posterior distributions, which include bayesian decision making. I will link to a great discussion on the subject by Thomas Wiecki on the subject here where we can see how to use our models to directly show the impact of uncertainy on real business metrics rather than arcane statistical metrics such as mean squared error, f1 score and the like which don’t hold any real business meaning.\nNaturally, I have my bias for these methods and using these models bring their own challenges. In some cases, traditional machine learning approaches would give better performance without sacrificing interpretability and help you reach a conclusion faster than using these bespoke modelling approaches. Nonetheless, I was on the lookout for an opportunity to find a dataset where I could exploit the natural hierarchical structure of data in a hierarchical modelling or the flexiblity of Gaussian process modelling to capture the intricaties of non-linear processes. The link shows the distinction between modelling the same problem as a regression vs using a gaussian process smoothing model.\nRevisiting the implementation once again Any data scientist or machine learning practitioner will tell you about their struggles with data. It’s either data quality (or lack thereof) or just the lack of data itself for performing interesting analyses. Then it suddenly occurred to me: property data is perfect for the experiments I wanted to conduct.\nScraping property prices over time gives the opportunity to model property …","date":1698156840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698156840,"objectID":"5b49bc16d699569b9faaa7c1093cee21","permalink":"https://rohailtaimour.com/a-scraper-that-scales-part-i/","publishdate":"2023-10-24T16:14:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/a-scraper-that-scales-part-i/","section":"post","summary":"Explore the journey of building a robust web scraper for analyzing Belgium's property market.
