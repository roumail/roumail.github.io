I am incredibly excited to announce that my website is officially live. üöÄ\nBuilt it Myself with Hugo üõ†Ô∏è\nIn the tech world, there are countless ways to build a website, many of which offer quick and easy solutions. However, I chose to take a different route by building this website myself using Hugo. The journey was challenging but immensely rewarding, providing me with hands-on experience that goes beyond just writing code.\nHosted on GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions üåê\nOne of the most enlightening aspects of this project was learning how to host a static website using GitHub Pages and automating the deployment process with GitHub Actions. Surprisingly, this was not as daunting as it sounds, and I found the experience to be relatively straightforward. Keep an eye out for a future blog post where I‚Äôll document this process in detail!\nCustomized to My Needs üé®\nThe journey didn‚Äôt stop at just building the website; I‚Äôve also customized it to suit my preferences and needs. This involved tweaking the template to accommodate blog series, implementing a contact form, and even adding the ability for visitors to comment on blog posts. One challenge still ahead is optimizing the website for SEO‚Äîturns out my MySpace account is incredibly resilient in search rankings!\nWhat‚Äôs Coming Up üìù\nThis website will serve as my digital canvas. I‚Äôll use it to share my insights and experiences on a range of topics: from Python development, machine learning, and data engineering, to open-source technology frameworks and beyond.\nYour Feedback is Welcome üôè\nFeel free to explore the website and let me know what you think. Your feedback is invaluable and will help me continue to improve this digital space.\nThank you for visiting, and stay tuned for exciting content!\nüîó www.rohailtaimour.com\n","date":1697500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697500800,"objectID":"d82060c7e468c61c4075a1ad9b4f47b8","permalink":"https://roumail.github.io/post/20231017-hello-world/","publishdate":"2023-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/20231017-hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"Rohail Taimour's blog!","tags":null,"title":"Welcome to my Website! üëã","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"- block: collection id: talks content: title: Recent \u0026amp; Upcoming Talks filters: folders: - event design: columns: ‚Äò2‚Äô view: compact # - block: portfolio # id: projects # content: # title: Projects # filters: # folders: # - project # # Default filter index (e.g. 0 corresponds to the first filter_button instance below). # default_button_index: 0 # # Filter toolbar (optional). # # Add or remove as many filters (filter_button instances) as you like. # # To show all items, set tag to ‚Äú*‚Äù. # # To filter by a specific tag, set tag to an existing tag name. # # To remove the toolbar, delete the entire filter_button block. # buttons: # - name: All # tag: ‚Äò*‚Äô # - name: Deep Learning # tag: Deep Learning # - name: Other # tag: Demo # design: # # Choose how many columns the section has.
