      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;milestone-unlocked-my-first-band&#34;&gt;Milestone unlocked: My first band&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m part of a number of different facebook groups where people post about
looking for jam partners or asking for information about where there&amp;rsquo;d be live
music playing in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a similar post in one of these groups asking for information about a
place I can book a practice room that contains a drum kit. As you would have it,
by a matter of pure luck, I got in touch with Nicholas, who was looking for a
drummer. It seems he happened to see one of my post looking for a rehearsal room
and decided to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking to play along with folks to get to that next
level as a musician. Practicing and improving your techniques is something I
really enjoy but at the end of the day, we play our preferred instruments to
make music. This was always something my drum teacher taught me that in the end,
the techniques and tools we have are always there to serve music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are certain aspects of playing music, which only come from
playing with each other. There is an element of communication, improvisation and
when these elements come together in a natural manner, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that&amp;rsquo;s
more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a video of the second single from the second time we&amp;rsquo;ve jammed together
as a group!&lt;/p&gt;
